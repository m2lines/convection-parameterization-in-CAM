# NN_module

This code is a standalone fortran module containing the fortran neural net and any dependencies extracted from the [original codebase](https://github.com/yaniyuval/Neural_nework_parameterization/tree/v.1.0.3).

It can be built on CSD3 by running:
```
./compile.sh
```
Note that you may need to use `chmod` to make this script executable first.
