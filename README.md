ML-based convenction parameterization originally trained and developed in
 [_Use of neural networks for stable, accurate and physically consistent parameterization of subgrid atmospheric processes with good performance at reduced precision_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09947) (Yuval, O'Gorman, Hill, 2021) with [associated code](https://github.com/yaniyuval/Neural_nework_parameterization/tree/v.1.0.3), re-deployed into CAM/CESM.
